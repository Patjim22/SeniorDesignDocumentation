This will use 2 conductor wire (can be telephone or any other 22 gauge wire) and a Solid State relay.

Attach the 2 conductor wire to the relay on the control +- side, then add the 2pin JST connector used on our main board to the other end. Attach the controlled devices' power lines to the Load +- with the voltage source on the + and the device being supplied on the - side.
